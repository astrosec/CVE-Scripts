# CVE-Scripts

A Linux based script that runs a custom implimentation of [CVE-Search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search) that allows for the production of detailed reports of software packaged on a system.

## Setup

---

This software requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on a Linux distrobution to run.

With Docker installed, open a terminal in the project directory then build the project with:

`sudo docker build -t cves .`

Run the Docker container:

`sudo docker run --rm -it -p5000:5000 --security-opt seccomp=unconfined cves`

Enter the docker container if you are not already inside with:

`sudo docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash`

To get the container id, run
`sudo docker ps`
and find the ID of the container named `cves`.

Download and process the CVE and CPE databases and start the webserver:

`cvedb -i -w`

This process could take over an hour depending on internet speed. Some of the progress bars don't function properly, but they are working. `-i` flag is what downloads and processes all the database data. This is only required to be done periodically to keep the database updated. To begin the webserver without reinitializing the entire database, just omit the `-i`.

Once it completes, the database websever will automatically start. To connect to the webserver, open a web browser and enter:

`http://localhost:5000`

## Performing a Query using cve_search.py

---

`cve_search.py` is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) script than can be used to effectively generate reports for software/version pair vulnerabilities.

The script can be run with the following flags in the format `python3 cve_search.py <flag> <arguments> ...`:

|  Flag  | Arguments | Description                     |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `-ap` or `--allPackages` | N/A       | Queries the database for all packages installed on the system the script is running on. |
| `-p` or `--package` | `<package>` `<version>` | Queries the database for the specified package/version pair. |
| `-f` or `--file` | `relative/path/to/file` | Queries the database for a series of package/version pairs supplied in the specified file. The format for said file must be `<package> <version>` with each separated by a new line. |
| `-r` or `--remote` | `http://databaseurl:port/<package>/<version>/ ...` | Sets the database url for queries to the specified url. This flag must be paired with another one to perform a query. |
| `-v` or `--verbose` | N/A | Will expand the reporting done by breaking down the package version into parts to query for. This will potentially list more vulnerabilities due to a much broader search, but the results might not be applicable to the actual installed software. |

All of these flags can be used together if desired. The results of the query will be compiled into `report.csv` inside the project directory.

## Creating a search plugin

---

This script uses a plugin system to aquire the list of software from the host machine for differing Operating Systems. If there isn't any plugin installed that supports your OS, you can very easily write your own or edit an existing one in Python. Plugins can be found in the `plugins/` folder.

There are only three required functions of a plugin:

`get_supported_os()`: Returns a set of supported OS varations in the format of `<OS>:<distro>`. For example, `Linux:debian`. The plugin will only run if the host OS is listed in this set. If you see that the plugin does work on your host system, but is not listed in the set, add your OS to allow it to function. The `<OS>` part is determined by the script by `platform.system()` from the [Platform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html) Python module. If the OS is Linux, the `<distro>` part is determined by `distro.id()` in the [Distro](https://pypi.org/project/distro/) Python module.

`get_software_list()`: Returns a formatted list of all the software installed and visible on the host system. The format must be `<product> <version>`.

`get_required_packages()`: Returns a set of python pip packages required for the selected module to run.
