Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) is a standard developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Mitre Corporation to provide a consistent way of identifying software and hardware products. The standard formatting of CPE is defined in NIST Special Publication 800-126 Rev. 4.

The standard CPE name format consists of a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that includes the following components:

"cpe:" - The fixed prefix for all CPE names.
"2.3" - The version of the CPE standard being used.
":" - A separator that separates the fixed prefix and the variable components.
"a" or "h" - A single character that indicates the type of product being identified, either "a" for application software or "h" for hardware.
":" - A separator that separates the type of product and the following components.
Vendor - The vendor name of the product.
Product - The name of the product.
Version - The version of the product.
Update - The update or service pack number of the product, if applicable.
Edition - The edition of the product, if applicable.
Language - The language of the product, if applicable.
An example of a CPE name in the standard format is: "cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:8.0.6001:sp1:x86:en-us"

In this example, "cpe:2.3" indicates that the CPE standard version 2.3 is being used. "a" indicates that the product being identified is an application software. "microsoft" is the vendor name, "internet_explorer" is the product name, "8.0.6001" is the version, "sp1" is the update, "x86" is the edition, and "en-us" is the language.
